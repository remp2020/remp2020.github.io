- Fixed retrieval of browser_id in `conversions:aggregate-events` command which leads to more thorough definition of user's conversion path. remp/remp#1049
  - Previously some events (mainly pageviews) could have been not matched correctly and missing in the aggregated data.
- Fixed occasional incorrect page_progress parameter being tracked causing progress update not to be tracked at all.
  - Due to JS floating points being JS floating points sometimes the page_progress was >1 which server refused to accept.
- Fixed issues with very slow author/section segment recalculation for instances with bigger amount of data. remp/remp#1088
