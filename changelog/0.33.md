### [AdminModule]

- **BREAKING:** Added access check for presenter's signals in administration _(presenters extending `AdminPresenter`)_. Please check & update admin group rights in administration _(http://crm.press/users/admin-group-admin/)_. remp/crm#1661
- Added list of failed hermes tasks into admin - background jobs with ability to resend message back into queue. remp/crm#777
- Fixed issues with select picker initialization in modals and dynamic snippets. remp/crm#1938
- Changed `flatpickr`'s default hour to 0 _(midnight)_. The most used default start of subscriptions _(and other entities in CRM)_ is midnight not noon. remp/helpdesk#688

### [ApiModule]

- Fixed possibility of input truncation in the `api_logs` table by extending the column length. remp/crm#1949
  - The migration might take some time (depending on the amount of data in `api_logs` table), but doesn't block the writes.
- Changed order of the information logged when JSON validation fails. If the request is too long, Sentry truncates logged message and we don't see errors. remp/crm#1967
  - Logging also `property` which caused error; it's not always part of error message coming from `JsonSchema\Validator`.
  - Moved error message raised by malformed JSON into errors section of response.

### [AppleAppstoreModule]

- Fixed type of `unified_receipt.latest_receipt_info.cancellation_reason` from integer to string. remp/crm#1972
- Added error logging for failed JSON parse. In case of Apple's ServerToServerNotification, failed JSON parse means payload changed and we need to fix it. remp/crm#1967

### [ApplicationModule]

- **BREAKING**: Updated [Hermes](https://github.com/tomaj/hermes) to v4 - see [changelog](https://github.com/tomaj/hermes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#changed). 
  - Replace any use of `Tomaj\Hermes\Restart\RestartInterface` with `Tomaj\Hermes\Shutdown\ShutdownInterface` to follow [new Hermes naming](https://github.com/tomaj/hermes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
  - Replace any use of `Tomaj\Hermes\Restart\RestartException` to `Tomaj\Hermes\Shutdown\ShutdownException` to follow [new Hermes naming](https://github.com/tomaj/hermes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
  - Replace any use of `@hermesRestart` in your config (neon) files with `@hermesShutdown`.
  - The signature of `Crm\ApplicationModule\Hermes\HermesTasksQueue::addTask` changed. If you use it in your custom implementation, please verify your usage:
    - Before: `addTask(string $task, float $executeAt)`.
    - After: `addTask(int $priority, string $task, float $executeAt)`.
  - If you have custom restart/shutdown implementation, please follow Hermes changelog.
- **BREAKING**: Changed how menu items are generated within `MenuContainer->getMenuItems()`. If position of menu item is taken, menu item is attached to next unused position. remp/crm#1920
  - If you relied on overwriting menu items by reusing the same position, please refer to `FrontendMenuDataProviderInterface` section of the README and unlink the menu item explictly. 
- Added `FrontendMenuDataProviderInterface` to implement data providers to add or remove frontend menu items based on more complex logic. All data providers have to implement `FrontendMenuDataProviderInterface` and attach to `frontend_menu` data provider placeholder. remp/crm#1818
- Fixed storing of `hermes_tasks.execute_at` date for failed jobs. Invalid date format could store zero dates instead of actual task execution date. remp/crm#1948
- Removed maximum version restriction of the `symfony/translation` package _(v4.4.13)_. Issue with incompatibility in `kdyby/translation` was fixed. remp/crm#1496
- Fixed issue with invalid created/execute date stored for failed hermes messages. remp/crm#1956
- Added support to execute read-only queries against the configured database replicas. See "Database replicas" block of the [README](https://github.com/remp2020/crm-application-module) file. remp/crm#1929
- Fixed support for migrations to be placed in the `/migrations` folder outside of all modules. remp/crm#1944
- Fixed occasional issue with missing original data in audit log records. remp/crm#1985

### [GooglePlayBillingModule]

- Added error logging for failed JSON parse. In case of Google's DeveloperNotification, failed JSON parse means payload changed and we need to fix it. remp/crm#1967

### [InvoicesModule]

- **BREAKING**: Moved constant `InvoiceGenerator::CAN_GENERATE_DAYS_LIMIT` to `InvoicesRepository::PAYMENT_INVOICEABLE_PERIOD_DAYS`. remp/crm#1267
- **BREAKING**: Command `SendInvoiceCommand` fails if invoice wasn't generated. There is no point of sending empty email from "send invoice" command. remp/crm#1267
- Moved `Invoices:invoiceDetails` page implementation to `InvoiceDetailsWidget`. With this change we can reuse invoice details form in multiple places. `InvoiceDetailsWidget` attaches to new `invoices.frontend.invoice_details` widget placeholder created in `Invoices:invoiceDetails` page, so page stays the same. remp/crm#1818
- Changed checking if invoice can be generated or is within invoiceable period from custom conditions to unified `InvoicesRepository->isPaymentInvoiceable()` and `InvoicesRepository->paymentInInvoiceablePeriod()` methods.
  - Affected are `InvoicesPresenter->actionDownloadInvoice()`, `InvoicesAdminPresenter->actionDownloadInvoice()` and `InvoiceButton` component.
  - No breaking change in functionality. Unified condition checking if payment is in invoiceable period is more precise _(see commit message for detailed explanation)_. remp/crm#1267
- Removed redundant check if invoicing was disabled in `InvoiceGenerator->renderInvoiceMailAttachment()`. Conditions if payment is invoiceable are checked later in `generate()`. Invoice is now attached to email also if it was generated but user disabled invoicing (after generation and) before email was sent. remp/crm#1267
  - Added handling for exceptions from `InvoiceGenerator->renderInvoiceMailAttachment()` where it was missing.

### [PaymentsModule]

- **BREAKING**: Fixed `RecurrentPaymentsRepository->calculateChargeAt()`. It will now throw exception if calculated next charge is invalid. remp/crm#1662
- **BREAKING**: Fixed `RecurrentPaymentsRepository->createFromPayment()`. If `calculateChargeAt()` throws exception, recurrent payment is stopped _(by system)_ instead of creating invalid recurrent. remp/crm#1662
- Expanded `user_agent` column (in `payments` table) string type to 2000 characters. remp/crm#1950

### [ProductsModule]

- Added `OrderStatusCriteria` scenario builder criteria. remp/crm#1910
- Moved `Orders:my` page implementation to `UserOrdersWidget`. With this change we can reuse user orders list in multiple places. `UserOrdersWidget` attaches to new `products.frontend.orders_my` widget placeholder created in `Orders:my` page, so page stays the same. remp/crm#1818
- Fixed saving products without `available_at` date. This column is nullable and strict mode returns error when empty string is sent. Migration fixes these invalid dates. remp/crm#1960
- Added `OrderStatusOnScenarioEnterCriteria` trigger scenario criteria. remp/crm#1570
- Renamed `OrderStatusCriteria` scenario criteria to `ActualOrderStatusCriteria` because of distinction from `OrderStatusOnScenarioEnterCriteria`. remp/crm#1570
- Pass order status to scenario directly from orders repository instead of fetching it in `OrderStatusChangeHandler`. remp/helpdesk#723
- Added validation for field `stock` in `ProductsForm` to be a non-negative integer. remp/crm#1983
- Added validation for fields `price` and `catalog_price` in `ProductsForm` to be a non-negative number. remp/crm#1982
- Changed `PaymentStatusChangeHandler` to allow updating order status to `paid` only when it has `new` status. remp/crm#1898

### [RempMailerModule]

- Added link to the newsletter editions, based on the "Page URL" setting of newsletter in Mailer admin. remp/crm#1946
- Changed behavior of admin widgets displaying email settings - settings are no longer displayed for unclaimed or anonymous users. remp/crm#1961

### [SubscriptionsModule]

- Fixed saving subscription types with incorrect `extending_length` values. This column is nullable and strict mode returns error when string is sent.remp/crm#1963
- Changed size of `subscriptions_meta.value` column to `VARCHAR(2000)`. remp/crm#1959
- Fixed subscription update. If `start_time` or `end_time` are changed, link to next subscription `next_subscription_id` is set to proper value. remp/crm#1882
- Fixed incorrect subscription alignment during subscription shortening if there are future subscriptions during subscription splitting process. remp/crm#1974
- Added subscription type name to `UserSubscriptionInfoWidget`. remp/crm#1980 

### [UsersModule]

- **BREAKING**: Added signal method prefix `handle` into `GenerateAccessCommand` (`user:generate_access`) to generate ACL resources for presenter's signals within administration _(presenters extending `AdminPresenter`)_. All signals are automatically allowed for all admin groups (to keep access for all admin users as before signals were introduced). This is one time seed. Please check & update admin group rights in administration _(http://crm.press/users/admin-group-admin/)_. remp/crm#1661
- **BREAKING**: Renamed `SsoRedirectValidator` to `SignInRedirectValidator`. remp/crm#1941
- Changed  `SsoUserManager::getUser()` method signature. remp/crm#1957
  - Added optional parameter `registrationChannel` to the end of parameter list. Change is backwards compatible.
- Added initial Apple Sign-In support using ID token and Authorization code flow. remp/crm#1924
- Merged `Users:changePassword`, `Users:requestPassword` and `Users:settings` pages together to `Users:settings` page. `Users:settings` is now available for all users, content of the page depends on whether user is logged in or not. remp/crm#1818
- Changed `Users:changePassword` and `Users:requestPassword` pages to deprecated and will be removed in the future. Requests are redirected to ``Users:settings`. remp/crm#1818
- Added `level` into `admin_access` table to indicate access level of resource _(read / write)_. Annotation `@admin-access-level` above resource method is used for setting level. They are loaded and stored into DB by UsersModule's `GenerateAccessCommand` (`user:generate_access`). remp/crm#1661
- Added `type` into `admin_access` table to indicate type of resource _(render / action / handle)_. These types are loaded from method prefix and stored into DB by UsersModule's `GenerateAccessCommand` (`user:generate_access`). remp/crm#1661
- Changed _(improved)_ UI for setting resource access (granting permissions) to admin groups. Added access types and levels and global/per module toggles _(eg. read only)_. remp/crm#1661
- Added the management of linked accounts into user's settings page. remp/crm#1922
- Added option `--cleanup` to `GenerateAccessCommand` (`user:generate_access`) command. When command is launched with this option, orphaned ACL resources and actions are removed. Can be used to remove remains after CRM module is uninstalled or presenter/method is (re)moved. remp/crm#1777
  - WARNING: This option doesn't fix ACL after resource is moved. That should be handled by module when resource is moved / renamed (eg. by migration).
- Changed `users.note` column from `VARCHAR(255)` to `TEXT`. More space is sometimes needed _(eg. notes about company accounts)_. remp/crm#1953
  - Set `note` input field to nullable _(stores NULL instead of empty string)_.
- Added option to set query parameter `n_source` when using Apple or Google Sign In to store user registration source. remp/crm#1957
- Added `registration_channel` column to `users` table. remp/crm#1957
    - This column refers to channel through which user was registered. Default value is `crm`. It's primarily designed to determine origin of the registration data and consent (e.g. Google sign in, Apple sign in).
