### [InvoicesModule]

- **IMPORTANT**: Fixed invoice's issued date (column `invoice.created_date`) to delivery date of pre-generated invoice number. remp/crm#2836
    - This change doesn't affect instances with disabled config `generate_invoice_number_for_paid_payment` (default state).
- **DEPRECATED**: Parameter `$invoiceNumber` of method `InvoicesRepository::add()` is deprecated. remp/crm#2775 & remp/crm#2804

    - Triggered when admin or user change user's invoice flags (either sets `user.invoice = 1` and/or `disable_auto_invoice = 0` ).

### [PaymentsModule]

    - Removed `ga()` calls and added data layer events.
    - Include Google Tag Manager in your page header code (`/admin/config-admin/` -> Shop page) to process data layer.

### [RempMailerModule]

- **BREAKING**: Changed tracking from Universal Analytics to Google Analytics 4.
    - Removed `ga()` calls and added data layer events.
    - Include Google Tag Manager in your page header code (`/admin/config-admin/` -> Application page) to process data layer.
- **BREAKING**: Changed front-end implementation of `MailSettings` module from Nette to Vue to speed up UX. remp/crm#2723
    - The change avoids un-necessary queries to Mailer API while re-rendering.
    - In case you programmatically changed `MailSettings` template, make sure you adjust to the new implementation.
- **BREAKING**: Removed API Client `unSubscribeUserVariant` method, since it has no support in Mailer. remp/crm#2723
    - Method `MailUserSubscriptionsRepository#unSubscribeUserVariant` calling the API function was also removed.

### [SubscriptionsModule]

- **BREAKING**: Changed how parameters `start_time` and `end_time` of method `SubscriptionsRepository::add()` and properties `fixed_start` and `fixed_end` of subscription type affect start and end of subscription. remp/crm#2550
    - The start datetime of the subscription is set to:
        - Method argument `start_time` if provided.
        - Subscription type's property `fixed_start` if `start_time` is not provided and `fixed_start` is bigger than current datetime.
        - Result of subscription type extender's method `ExtensionInterface::getDate()` if `start_time` and `fixed_start` are not set.
    - The end datetime of the subscription is set to:
        - Method argument `end_time` if provided.
        - Subscription type's property `fixed_end` if `end_time` is not provided and `fixed_end` is bigger than final start datetime.
        - Result of subscription type length's method `LengthMethodInterface::getEndTime()` if `end_time` and `fixed_end` are not set.
        - If final end datetime is before final start datetime, end datetime is set to start datetime (subscription cannot end before start).
- Changed `FixDaysLengthMethod` to not handle subscription type's property `fixed_end`. remp/crm#2550
    - Handling of subscription type's property `fixed_end` was moved into `SubscriptionsRepository::add()` (`fixed_start` was already there).
    - `FixDaysLengthMethod` now calculates end of subscription only from length.
- Fixed use of _final const_, which is not compatible with still supported PHP 8.0.
- Changed admin filter collapsing rules to improve UX. remp2020/crm-users-module#17
