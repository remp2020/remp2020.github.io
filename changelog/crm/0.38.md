    - If you used `upgrade` type either install the gifts module or register type in your configuration with `registerType()` method.

### UsersModule

- **BREAKING**: Changed `UsersRepository::add()` function signature. remp/crm#2060
  - Removed `firstName`, `lastName` and `address` arguments as they're not mandatory anymore and `AddressRepository` / `UserMetaRepository` should preferably be used to store these fields. If you want to store them in `users` table, update the `$user` row right after the `add()` method.
  - Added `preregistration` argument to support new user pregeristration flow.
  - If you use `UsersRepository::add()` in your own modules, please revise the usage to reflect the changes.
- **BREAKING**: Changed `UserCreatedEvent` event to `UserRegisteredEvent`. Old `UserCreatedEvent` extends new `UserRegisteredEvent` so custom implementations dependent on `UserCreatedEvent` should work for now. `UserCreatedEvent` event is deprecated and will be removed in the future. remp/crm#2060
  - If you emit or listen to `UserCreatedEvent`, change it to `UserRegisteredEvent`.
  - This change intends to create room for user to be created, but not officially registered - intended for unclaimed users and other backend-only users. Unless you work with backend-only flows, `UserRegisteredEvent` is the one that you want to use onwards. This event is complemented with `NewUserEvent`. Read their PhpDocs if you want to know more.
  - Any scenarios using `user_created` trigger will automatically be migrated to `user_registered` trigger.
- **BREAKING**: Renamed `user-created` hermes event to `user-registered` to maintain consistency with the previous changes. remp/crm#2060
  - If you emit or listen to the `user-created` hermes event, update it to the new `user-registered` hermes event.
- Added option to `/api/v1/users/create` API endpoint to create unclaimed user. remp/crm#2060
