# Changelog - CRM 2.7

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). Instead of change type headers, we use module names.

### [AdminModule]

- Added option to propagate flatpickr `allowInvalidPreload` config through `flatpickr_allow_invalid_preload` HTML attribute. remp/crm#2888

### [ApplicationModule]

- **IMPORTANT**: Added `application:bigint_migration_cleanup` command, which drops left-over tables, after migration to bigint for `audit_logs` and `api_logs` tables. remp/crm#2591
  - It's recommended to run this command at least 2 weeks after migrating (to preserve backup data, if some issue emerges) after successful migration to drop left-over tables.
- Added support for select boxes to application config forms. remp/crm#2799
- Fixed missing where condition in Measurements' `*Scale` classes. remp/crm#2864
  - Where condition can be set with `Crm\ApplicationModule\Graphs\Criteria::setWhere()` method.
- Fixed null keys when fetching aggregated measurement group values. Display `system.not_available` _(N/A)_ instead of empty string. remp/crm#2864
- Fixed possible presence of port in the `Crm\ApplicationModule\Request::getDomain` return value. remp2020/crm-application-module#8

### [CouponModule]

- Fixed coupon filter for `type` column. Lowercasing searched type and types returned from database. Coupon types `example` and `Example` should be grouped together. remp/crm#2877

### [FamilyModule]

- Added validation rule to item `price` field in `RequestForm`. Price has to be positive numeric value with max. 2 decimal places. remp/crm#2817

### [InvoicesModule]

- **BREAKING**: Changed `InvoicesRepository::paymentInInvoiceablePeriod` from static to instance method. remp/crm#2799
- Added option to configure how long after purchase (or end of the month) should be generation of payment's invoice allowed. remp/crm#2799
  - Until now invoice could be generated 15 days after purchase date. This behavior is kept (no breaking change) by presetting this config to "15 days after purchase date".
  - See [CRM Admin -> Settings](http://crm.press/admin/config-admin/) -> Invoices; option "Invoice generation - limit related to" (`generate_invoice_limit_from`) and "Invoice generation - time restriction (in days)" (`generate_invoice_limit_from_days`).
  - **IMPORTANT**: This config is restricted: If number of days is bigger than 15, system requires you to enable config "Generate an invoice number for every paid payment" (`generate_invoice_number_for_paid_payment`).

### [PaymentsModule]

- Added configurable fast charge threshold ([README](https://github.com/remp2020/crm-payments-module/#fast-charge-check-configuration)). Default setting is kept unchanged (1 day). remp/crm#2842
- Added widget placeholders for recurrent payment actions into main recurrent payments listing and user detail recurrent payment listing. remp/crm#2867
  - You can now use `payments.admin.user_payments.listing.recurrent.actions` to attach your own custom actions to recurrent payments listing in admin.
- Added widget placeholder for payment sum in payments admin listings (main listing and user detail). remp/crm#2874
  - You can now use `payments.admin.listing.sum` to attach your own additional information/links to the payment sum.
- Fixed broken subscription type form change in admin detail of a payment (available only in `form` state). remp/helpdesk#1956 

### [ProductsModule]

- Added `PreNotificationEventHandler` which adds list of payment items to notification params so they can be listed in email. remp/crm#2812
  - Usage in Mailer template:
    ```twig
    <ul>
      {% for item in payment_items %}
      <li>{{ item.name }} - {{ item.count }} &times; {{ item.amount|format_currency('EUR') }} (VAT: {{ item.vat }}%)</li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    ```
- Removed requirement to provide `status` in `OrdersRepository::update()` when updating order. remp/crm#2880

### [RempMailerModule]

- Changed UI of admin component to manage newsletters in user detail page to hide unsubscribed newsletters by default. remp/crm#2883
- Fixed incorrect state of admin component to manage newsletters after submission (missing times, showing state as it was submitted). remp/crm#2883
- Fixed newsletter subscription not correctly propagating to Mailer if the user/email records weren't present in Mailer yet. remp/crm#2883

### [SalesFunnelModule]

- Added `prepaid` _(eg. Google Play / Apple Appstore)_ payments into sales funnel's graphs. These are linked through `sales_funnel_id` to funnel and should be part of statistics. remp/crm#2858
  - Affected graphs: "Items bought" (`SubscriptionsGraph`), "Ratio of recurrent and non-recurrent payments" (`RecurrentAndNotRecurrentPaymentsGraph`), "Payments by payment gateway" (`PaymentGatewaysGraph`).

### [SubscriptionsModule]

- **BREAKING**: Class `Crm\SubscriptionsModule\Repository\SubscriptionTypeContentAccess` was renamed to `Crm\SubscriptionsModule\Repository\SubscriptionTypeContentAccessRepository`. remp/crm#2875
  - If you reference this class in your modules, please update the referenced class.
  - Name of the DI service was also renamed from `subscriptionTypeContentAccess` to `subscriptionTypeContentAccessRepository`.
- **DEPRECATED**: Deprecated `subscription_type` table columns originally used for content access definition (`web`, `print`, `club`, `mobile`, `print_friday`, `ad_free`).
  - Use defined records from the `content_access` table and links from `subscription_type_content_access` table.
- **DEPRECATED**: Deprecated method `Crm\SubscriptionsModule\Repository\SubscriptionTypesRepository::getPrintSubscriptionTypes` in favor of `Crm\SubscriptionsModule\Repository\ContentAccessRepository::hasAccess('print')`.
- Added few missing CZ translations. [remp2020/crm-subscriptions-module#11](https://github.com/remp2020/crm-subscriptions-module/pull/11)
- Added new events in the subscription type life-cycle scenario. remp/crm#2875
  - `Crm\SubscriptionsModule\Events\SubscriptionTypeCreatedEvent` emitted when new subscription type is created.
  - `Crm\SubscriptionsModule\Events\SubscriptionTypeUpdatedEvent` emitted when subscription type is updated.
  - `Crm\SubscriptionsModule\Events\ContentAccessAssignedEvent` emitted when content access is assigned to the subscription type. Event is emitted for each assigned content access separately. 
  - `Crm\SubscriptionsModule\Events\ContentAccessUnassignedEvent` emitted when content access is unassigned from the subscription type. Event is emitted for each unassigned content access separately. 

### [UpgradesModule]

- Fixed handling of redirect url returned from payment gateway in `PaidExtendWidget`. remp/crm#2865

### [UsersModule]

- **DEPRECATED**: Deprecated `users.last_sign_in_at` and `users.last_sign_in_ip` columns. remp/crm#2871
  - The columns hold information about the second last sign in. The last (current) sign in is kept in `current_sign_in_at` and `current_sign_in_ip`. Since the actual use of deprecated columns is highly unlikely, we don't provide an out-of-the-box alternate way to preserve them.
- Fixed the information displayed in the "Last login" box of the user's detail page in the admin. remp/crm#2871
  - System previously displayed second last login information, not the last one.
- Added new graph to [user stats screen](http://crm.press/users/dashboard/) which shows registration through sales funnels. remp/crm#2864
- Replaced use of `SegmentFactory` with `SegmentFactoryInterface` in the `user:reconstruct_user_data` command. [remp2020/crm-users-module#19](https://github.com/remp2020/crm-users-module/pull/19)
