- **BREAKING**: Changed Latte version from v2 to v3. remp/crm#2519
- Added universal search to search across whole application. remp/crm#2485
    - Added `UniversalSearchWidget` to display search box in header on all admin pages.
    - Added `UniversalSearchDataProviderInterface` data provider to implement custom search models in modules.
    - Added `admin.dataprovider.universal_search` data provider placeholder to register custom search models.

### [ApiModule]

- **BREAKING**: Changed PHP version requirement to 8.0. remp/crm#2519
- **BREAKING**: Changed Latte version from v2 to v3. remp/crm#2519
- Changed API handling to allow `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` to be present in all requests, not only preflight requests. remp/crm#2514

### [AppleAppstoreModule]

- **BREAKING**: Changed PHP version requirement to 8.0. remp/crm#2519
- Fixed unnecessary warning regarding `exclude_old_transactions` option in Apple's validation request. remp/crm#2515
- Fixed possibly discarded server-to-server notification if both cancellation and subscription fields are present. remp/crm#2516

### [ApplicationModule]

- **BREAKING**: Changed PHP version requirement to 8.0. remp/crm#2519
- **BREAKING**: Changed Latte version from v2 to v3. remp/crm#2519
- **BREAKING**: Changed library used for translations. remp/crm#2519
    - In your `config.neon`, please change registered translation extension from `Kdyby\Translation\DI\TranslationExtension` to `Contributte\Translation\DI\TranslationExtension`.
    - In your `config.neon`, change the configuration of translation extension to following snippet and alter where necessary:
  ```neon
  translation:
      dirs:
          - %appDir%/lang
      locales:
          default: en_US
          whitelist: [en_US, sk_SK, cs_CZ]
      localeResolvers:
          - Contributte\Translation\LocalesResolvers\Parameter
          - Contributte\Translation\LocalesResolvers\Router
      loaders:
          neon: Contributte\Translation\Loaders\Neon
          yml: Symfony\Component\Translation\Loader\YamlFileLoader
  ```
    - If you implement your own DI extensions with translations, change the implemented translation interface from `Kdyby\Translation\DI\ITranslationProvider` to `Contributte\Translation\DI\TranslationProviderInterface`. You'll need to alter `getTranslationResources()` signature based on the interface.
    - After all the changes, remove the cache in the `temp/nette/cache/*` folder.
- **BREAKING**: Changed signature of methods in `\Crm\ApplicationModule\Graphs\Scale\ScaleInterface`, new types added. remp/crm#1309
    - If you implement your own scale (probably not), you need to update the signature of implementing methods. Otherwise this doesn't affect you.
    - Method `getKeys` now has string types: `public function getKeys(string $start, string $end)`.
    - Method `getDatabaseData` now has string `$tag` parameter: `public function getDatabaseData(Criteria $criteria, string $tag)`.
- Added support for measurements - precalculated values which can be used in charts or any kind of period-based statistics. remp/crm#1309
    - **IMPORTANT**: Some charts now use measurements as the source of data. To make sure they work correctly, please:
        - Run `php bin/command.php application:calculate-measurement` once after the deploy to calculate all values for currently active measurements.
        - Add `php bin/command.php application:calculate-measurement --daily" to be run daily to update values of currently active periods.
    - Measurements are meant to replace expensive on-the-fly calculations, for example number of active subscribers each day/week/month/year. Measurements generate the values for every day/week/month/year and can be further grouped by an extra parameter - for example new registrations by source/channel/etc.
- Added new `localizedDate` filter to format dates with locale. Uses `locale` stored in user account for logged-in users and app default locale for others. remp/crm#2488
- Fixed issues with filter registration appearing after `latte/latte` update to version `2.11.5`. remp/crm#2511
- Added new `PreviousNextPaginator` paginator, because of `VisualPaginator` performance issues. remp/crm#2512
- Fixed getting Hermes tasks based on priority. Queues were sorted in the order in which they were registered and not based on queue priority. remp/crm#2548
- Added `locale` parameter to `NotificationEvent` to localize sent notifications. remp/crm#2533

### [CouponModule]

### [FamilyModule]

- **BREAKING**: Changed PHP version requirement to 8.0. remp/crm#2519
- Fixed issue with subscription without the reference to family request. remp/crm#2349
    - These subscriptions could be generated when request with different status than created was used (eg. it was activated by different actor between page load and request activation). Now responsible service and related API call `/api/v1/family/activate` return error.

### [GiftsModule]

- **BREAKING**: Changed PHP version requirement to 8.0. remp/crm#2519

### [GooglePlayBillingModule]

- **BREAKING**: Changed PHP version requirement to 8.0. remp/crm#2519
- **BREAKING**: Removed storing of `payment_meta` key `cancel_datetime` for cancellations / expirations where cancel date is not provided. Field `userCancellationTimeMillis` is present in subscription response only for `cancelReason=0` (user cancelled subscription). Otherwise `1970-01-01 01:00:00` was stored. remp/crm#2431
    - Migration removes all `payment_meta` with `key=cancel_datetime` and `value=1970-01-01 01:00:00`.
- **BREAKING**: Changed return type of `SubscriptionResponseProcessorInterface->getUserCancellationTime()` to nullable `?DateTime`. remp/crm#2431
- Fixed unhandled upgrades. remp/crm#2431
    - This is combination of two notifications. Notification type 4 (`PURCHASE`) and type 13 (`SUBSCRIPTION_EXPIRED`). Both were in case of upgrade ignored. New purchase had same end time as previous subscription so new subscription wasn't created. And we also ignored expired notification type, because in case of cancellation or expiration end time of current subscription doesn't change. This fix adds new checks to allow upgrades/downgrades.

### [GoPayModule]

- **BREAKING**: Changed PHP version requirement to 8.0. remp/crm#2519

### [InvoicesModule]

- **BREAKING**: Changed PHP version requirement to 8.0. remp/crm#2519
- **BREAKING**: Changed Latte version from v2 to v3. remp/crm#2519
- **BREAKING**: Changed the signature of method `InvoiceItemsRepository::add()` - added argument `priceWithoutVat`. remp/crm#1323
    - Added new column `price_without_vat` into `invoice_items` table.
    - Changed invoice template. Price without vat is now not calculated but loaded from item.
        - Existing columns `price` & `vat` are not removed (yet), so you don't need to change template. But we advice using new column.
    - Invoice item price without vat is stored from payment item when adding invoice (by `InvoicesRepository::add()`).
- Fixed condition that blocked invoice generation by admins if the invoice address was missing optional `company_tax_id`. remp/crm#2560

### [IssuesModule]

### [PaymentsModule]

- **BREAKING**: Changed PHP version requirement to 8.0. remp/crm#2519
- **BREAKING**: Changed Latte version from v2 to v3. remp/crm#2519
- **BREAKING**: Changed that user stats computed by `payments:calculate_averages`  command (`subscription_payments`, `subscription_payments_amount`, `avg_month_payment`) are now stored and loaded from/to `user_stats` table, instead of `user_meta` table. remp/crm#2207
    - Added new command option `--delete`, that deletes old stats data first from both `user_stats` and `user_meta` (where data was stored previously) tables.
    - Added command option `--user_id` to compute values for single user.
- **BREAKING**: Changed signature of `\Crm\PaymentsModule\Gateways\ExternallyChargedRecurrentPaymentInterface` interface. remp/crm#2515
    - The method `getLatestReceiptExpiration()` is changed to `getSubscriptionExpiration(string $cid = null)`. You only need to handle this if you implement `ExternallyChargedRecurrentPaymentInterface` in your own payment gateways.
- **BREAKING**: Changed mail parsers / downloaders to fulfil parameter and return types added to `Tomaj\BankMailsParser\Parser\ParserInterface`. remp/crm#1029
    - `ParserInterface->parse()` method now returns `?MailType` and array is not allowed. To parse multi-transactional emails, call `parseMulti()` alternative of mail parser. This is relevant to classes:
        - `Crm\PaymentsModule\MailParser\CsobMailParser`,
        - `Crm\PaymentsModule\MailParser\SkCsobMailParser`,
        - `Crm\PaymentsModule\MailParser\TatraBankaStatementMailParser`.
- **BREAKING**: Added parameter & return types into `TatraBankaMailDecryptor`. remp/crm#1029
- Updated `tomaj/bank-mails-parser` to version 2.7. remp/crm#1029
    - If valid variable symbol was not found, new version tries to load it from less valid formats (eg. missing VS prefix, or VS entered into incorrect field). See details in ticket [tomaj/bank-mails-parser#10](https://github.com/tomaj/bank-mails-parser/issues/10)
- Added javascript to prevent double clicks on the select card page which has produced errors. remp/crm#2479
- Added `UniversalSearchDataProvider` for custom searches in payments using variable symbol. remp/crm#2485
- Refactored presenters to use `PreviousNextPaginator` instead of `VisualPaginator`. remp/crm#2512
- Added throw exception in the case of payment copying fail. remp/crm#2541
- Added error logging in case we are unable to parse bank statement (Tatrabanka, ČSOB). remp/crm#1029
- Changed way how payments and related items are copied. Now payment items are generated according actual subscription type items instead of the direct copy of previous payment items. remp/crm#2500
